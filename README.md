// Generate using?:
const config = JSON.stringify({ name: 'playwright', command: 'npx', args: ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"] });
const urlForWebsites = `vscode:mcp/install?${encodeURIComponent(config)}`;

## Configuration to use Playwright Server

### ðŸŽ¯ **Using This Fork (with Mouse Commands)**

For Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user playwright -- npx github:yeswecan/mcp-playwright-fork
```

For Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["github:yeswecan/mcp-playwright-fork"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ðŸ“¦ **Using Original Version**

Here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the original Playwright server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

This project uses Jest for testing. The tests are located in the `src/__tests__` directory.

### Running Tests

You can run the tests using one of the following commands:

```bash
# Run tests using the custom script (with coverage)
node run-tests.cjs

# Run tests using npm scripts
npm test           # Run tests without coverage
npm run test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:custom    # Run tests with custom script (same as node run-tests.cjs)
```

The test coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` directory.

### Running evals

The evals package loads an mcp client that then runs the index.ts file, so there is no need to rebuild between tests. You can load environment variables by prefixing the npx command. Full documentation can be found [here](https://www.mcpevals.io/docs).

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key  npx mcp-eval src/evals/evals.ts src/tools/codegen/index.ts
```

## Contributing

When adding new tools, please be mindful of the tool name length. Some clients, like Cursor, have a 60-character limit for the combined server and tool name (`server_name:tool_name`).

Our server name is `playwright-mcp`. Please ensure your tool names are short enough to not exceed this limit.
