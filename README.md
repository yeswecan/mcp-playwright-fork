#### Installation in VS Code

Install the Playwright MCP server in VS Code using one of these buttons:

<!--
// Generate using?:
const config = JSON.stringify({ name: 'playwright', command: 'npx', args: ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"] });
const urlForWebsites = `vscode:mcp/install?${encodeURIComponent(config)}`;
// Github markdown does not allow linking to `vscode:` directly, so you can use our redirect:
const urlForGithub = `https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=${encodeURIComponent(urlForWebsites)}`;
-->

Alternatively, you can install the Playwright MCP server using the VS Code CLI:

```bash
# For VS Code
code --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]}'
```

```bash
# For VS Code Insiders
code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]}'
```

After installation, the ExecuteAutomation Playwright MCP server will be available for use with your GitHub Copilot agent in VS Code.

## Configuration to use Playwright Server
Here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the Playwright server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## SSE (Server-Sent Events) Support

Playwright MCP Server now supports real-time event streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

### How to Use

- The server exposes an SSE endpoint at `http://localhost:3001/events`.
- You can connect to this endpoint using any SSE-compatible client (such as EventSource in the browser or curl).
- Events are sent in real-time as they occur (e.g., new console logs, screenshots, etc.).

### Example (JavaScript)
```js
const evtSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:3001/events');
evtSource.addEventListener('console_log_entry', (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Console log:', data.log);
});
evtSource.addEventListener('screenshot', (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Screenshot event:', data);
});
```

### Available Events
- `console_log_entry`: Fired when a new console log is captured.
- `console_logs`: Fired when all logs are requested.
- `screenshot`: Fired when a screenshot is taken or requested.

This allows you to build real-time dashboards, monitoring tools, or simply observe browser activity as it happens.

## Testing

This project uses Jest for testing. The tests are located in the `src/__tests__` directory.

### Running Tests

You can run the tests using one of the following commands:

```bash
# Run tests using the custom script (with coverage)
node run-tests.cjs

# Run tests using npm scripts
npm test           # Run tests without coverage
npm run test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:custom    # Run tests with custom script (same as node run-tests.cjs)
```

The test coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` directory.
